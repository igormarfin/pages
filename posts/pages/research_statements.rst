My research focuses on the physics of fundamental particles and forces at high energies.
One of the outstanding mysteries is the mechanism by which particles acquire mass. 
This is currently, the hottest topic in High Energy Physics (HEP), which the experiments at 
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear
Research) in Switzerland will answer.  
Using 7 TeV and 8 TeV data,   the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have announced   
the discovery of a new boson with mass of 125 GeV [#Chatrchyan:2012ufa]_   during a special seminar at CERN  on 4th of July 2012.


The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) [#Bayatian:922757]_ is one of the two general purpose
detectors at the LHC. The CMS was  built to detect the products of the
proton-proton collisions with high collision energies  up to tens of TeVs.
The LHC had a tremendous success last years. Many exploration and tests 
of the standard model (SM) physics and a wide spectrum of searches for new
physics beyond the SM have been recently made. The one of the prime aims of the LHC 
is  a study of the Higgs boson properties.
Measurements of the coupling strength between the boson and third-generation SM particles, like
top,bottom quarks and tau lepton, would allow to understand the properties of the newly discovered boson.
Such studies would be driven by the complex analysis of  two channels:
`$H\rightarrow \tau\tau $` and `$H\rightarrow b\bar{b}. $`
They play a crucial test of the Higgs mechanism in the SM and in the theories beyond it. 


Even after a great experimental success, the SM suffers from some 
theoretical problems such as: instability
of the Higgs boson mass against radiative correction, hierarchy of the fundamental scales, hierarchy
in the masses of fermions, mechanism to break the electroweak symmetry, mechanism of CP violation
etc. Some or all of these problems are addressed in various models of physics beyond the SM, such as
models with extra-dimensions, with supersymmetry, or with other additional symmetries. Each of these
model invariably propose new heavy particles that can potentially be produced at the LHC.

I am interested in pursing physics involving the Higgs boson interaction 
with the third-generation SM particles like  bottom quarks.  
I am confident that my
extensive research experience allows me significantly contribute in these efforts. 
I already play an important role in studying the Higgs physics  with b jets, 
`$$pp\rightarrow b+H\rightarrow 3b+jets,$$` which I perform within 
my doctoral scholarships in DESY CMS Higgs group.  My activity in the Higgs searches is complement by 
my expertise of the online procedure, the High Level Trigger [#Bayatyan:11111]_\ , 
to filter multi-jets events recorded by the CMS detector. 
I am one of the primary authors of the search for the neutral Higgs boson decaying 
to pair of `$b\bar{b}$`  quarks in association with b-quark  performed at 7 TeV
data [#Chatrchyan:2013qga]_\ . The analysis covers the neutral Higgs sector in minimal SUSY scenarios. 
The CMS is only experiment at LHC which published these unique results so far.
One of my primary contributions was a Monte Carlo study on the signal and background kinematics
to optimize the offline pre-selection  criteria of the analysis. This yields 
an improvement of the search sensitivity in this challenging channel. 
I have developed the method of multivariate analysis used to validate the Higgs search procedure 
in a unbiased way. I have further expanded my research experience investigating the effects 
of the  systematic uncertainties  in  the analysis. I have played one of the main roles in 
obtaining the final results, developing
a fitting procedure used to extract the  observed cross section of the Higgs boson production.  
Using statistical procedures,  I have performed the calculation of the exclusion limits 
on  parameters of extended Higgs models like  the theory of Supersymmetry.


The large hadronic interaction rate at the LHC  poses  great challenges  for triggering the events with 
signature  of three b jets in the final state. To reduce 
significantly the event rate with preserving the signal efficiency, the dedicated full hadronic
trigger with b-jet identification algorithms (b-tagging)   was developed by our group.

To ensure high efficient performance of b-tagging at the HLT,  I
serve as one of the active developers of such algorithms within the CMS Trigger Study Group at CERN. 
In particular, one of my primary responsibility is to supervise 
and control  efforts in the optimization of the online b-tagging.
All  improvements of b-jet tagging at the HLT are important not only for the
`$bH\rightarrow 3b$` production  but also for the analyses with boosted Higgs bosons, and a number of beyond
SM searches that have b jets in the final state. 
The current upgrade of the b-tagging  at HLT  will guaranty that the CMS detector performance 
and data analysis methods are optimal for the high-intensity, high pileup
environment of the next LHC runs which are planned to start at the centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV.



Due to my experience , I have in the `$bH\rightarrow 3b$`  search
and in b-jet identification, I would significantly contribute  
to the GROUP [#ref]_ program and its efforts with the CMS experiment.

The first task in any collider data analysis, and especially in the search for new physics, is to ensure
that the relevant collisions are recorded in a efficient way for later analyses. 
During the first half of the fellowship, I propose to continue  my current work with the
CMS High Level Trigger. My position as trigger software validation co-coordinator 
will allow me to use the lessons which I learned from the operation of HLT in 2012 data taking. 
I will identify  the directions for the software upgrade of HLT during the current long shutdown. 
The strong involvement of the  GROUP [#ref]_  in the trigger studies
would make it an ideal place to develop this activity.  
Also I plan to clarify  the strategic trigger needs of the Higgs analyses with data to be collected in the
upcoming LHC runs.
In addition to that, the set of the control triggers should be developed for  estimations of the       
the Higgs triggers efficiencies.

                                                         
The second half of the fellowship will correspond to a period when the LHC will start running  
at 14 TeV energy with high luminosity and pile-up.
During this period,  I propose  to contribute   to measurements of production cross sections   
for `$b\bar{b}H$` and `$t\bar{t}H$` processes.
This analysis will rely on  the triggers with b-tagging  studied at the previous step of the fellowship. 
My experience of the trigger software will be hugely valuable me in this task.


After obtaining the first measurements of the production cross section,  
the `$H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$` and `$H\rightarrow \tau\bar{\tau}$`
would be ideal  observable channels for the Higgs
boson couplings to the third-generation fermions.  The next step will be to investigate 
such couplings and verify whether they correspond to the SM prediction, or if 
we have a deal with  a more complex scenario.
The LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group has
recently published recommendations for the parametrization of measurements to explore the
Higgs couplings   [#LHCHiggsCrossSectionWorkingGroup:2012nn]_\ . For example, 
it can be achieved by observing the Higgs boson in the channels, and calculating the 
the ratios of Higgs production cross sections of the channels.


If  the evidence for a Higgs boson in the 
`$$t\bar{t}H,\,\, b\bar{b}H,\,\, H\rightarrow \tau\bar{\tau},b\bar{b}$$`  would be found, 
I intend to measure its CP quantum number [#Soni:1993jc]_\ . 
So, for example, the observation of a CP-odd Higgs candidate would exclude the SM Higgs which
is CP-even. 
If the studying the properties of the Higgs sector would demonstrate that the current
Higgs excess is not SM-like, it would offer the first convincing evidence of the Supersymmetry.
Observables of the CP quantum number  involve the polarizations and/or spin correlations 
of the Higgs decay products  and the associated heavy flavor, top or bottom, quark(s) with it. 
The polarization observables are strongly related to the azimuthal distributions of
leptons either from the top quark or the Higgs boson decays. 
The polarizations of  particles are usually studied by means of kinematical   distributions.



While the outlined Higgs boson study  
would likely take a few years, I also would like to get engaged in
the CMS upgrade activity to extend my research experience. 
It would be very important  to have a
hands-on experience with the hardware that helps me to efficiently contribute to
the CMS detector operations in future.


In summary, I would be enthusiastic to gear my efforts towards the  measuring 
all of the couplings of the new resonance. My strong experience of
the CMS HLT  and  data analysis tools, my knowledge and publications in wide variety of topics,  
covering both the theoretical and experimental physics aspects,  
makes me well-prepared to tackle this  very exciting investigation of  
the electroweak symmetry breaking in  future pp collisions at the LHC.

Working  with such  team of brilliant and motivated people is a huge opportunity for me.
A post-doctoral position in GROUP [#ref]_  is an excellent match for my researches.
As a post-doctoral researcher, I will endeavor  to distribute an atmosphere  of  the DESY CMS Higgs group 
where  knowledge and experience are easily shared among collaborators, and  to continue  to take
initiative in leading projects.

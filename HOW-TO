Section First (stored in context)
=================================

Section Title(1)
-----------------
Just an example of the code blocks:


.. code:: bash
    :number-lines: 1

    gedit pohl.m
    ./test.sh
    printf "%s" "OK"


.. code-block:: c

   #include <iostream>
    void test() { 
    std::cout<<"test"<<std::endl; 
    return ;

    }

.. code:: c
   :number-lines: 001

   #include <iostream>
    void test() { 
    std::cout<<"test"<<std::endl; 
    return ;

    }


.. code-block:: python


   def test():
   """ test """
    print "How are you"?

    return

Section Third
==============



Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indicated with a double-colon ("::") at the end of
the preceding paragraph (over there ``-->``).  They can be indented::

    if literal_block:
        text = 'is left as-is'
        spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
        markup_processing = None


Or they can be quoted without indentation::

>> Great idea!
>
> Why didn't I think of that?


Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    My theory by A. Elk.  Brackets Miss, brackets.  This theory goes
    as follows and begins now.  All brontosauruses are thin at one
    end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the
    far end.  That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I
    own it, and what it is too.

    -- Anne Elk (Miss)

Section Fourth
===============


Citations
---------

.. [CIT2002] Citations are text-labeled footnotes. They may be
   rendered separately and differently from footnotes.

Here's a reference to the above, [CIT2002]_ citation.

Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnote reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.





Section Fifth
===============



Targets
-------

.. _example:

This paragraph is pointed to by the explicit "example" target. A
reference can be found under `Section Second`_, above. 

Section headers are implicit targets, referred to by name. See
Targets_.

Explicit external targets are interpolated into references such as
"Python_" or such as [#python2]_.


.. _Python: http://www.python.org/

.. [#python2] http://www.python.org/  


Targets may be indirect and anonymous.  Thus `this phrase`__ may also
refer to the Targets_ section.
